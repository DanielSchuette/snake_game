# Snake Game
The classic [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre) video game, built using SDL2 and basic C++. This is a personal project to explore the capabilities of SDL2.

```bash
make all                      # build the game
./snake <player_name> <speed> # play the game
make clean                    # clean up build artifacts
```
